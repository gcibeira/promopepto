# promopepto
Promopepto is a simple custom Windows application that allows you to track customer purchases. It utilizes a json file stored locally as a database, and implements a logging feature to log user activity in a plain text file.
Upon first execution, you will be prompted to select a folder to save the database file (json) and the log file.

The interface consists of a grid with customer names, a filter to aid in searching, and a side menu to edit customer credits.
